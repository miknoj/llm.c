# Jonathan's Todo list
- [X] Run the `quick start (CPU)` steps.
- [X] Compile train_gpt2.c with debug symbols on.
- [X] Step through one training step of train_gpt2.c with the lldb debugger `lldb ./train_gpt2`.
- [ ] Compare the code of train_gpt2.c against train_gpt2.cu to see the difference.
- [ ] Compile train_gpt2.cu on a machine with a big enough GPU.
- [ ] Step through one training step of train_gpt2.cu with the cuda-dbg debugger.
